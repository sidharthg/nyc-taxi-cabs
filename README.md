# Reclaiming NYC streets
## An analytical case study of NYC taxi data
This project was conducted as part of an Analytics Case Competition. The task for the competition was to select an area to analyze using all or a subset of the taxi data from New York City. Supplementary data sources may also be used. The area selected should reflect a relevant business problem for the taxicab industry. Teams were asked to prepare and give a presentation to share their analysis and results. 

This repository provides the code, visualizations and final presentation developed during the course of our analysis.

## Business problem
The question that our team has tried to answer is:
**How can NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) increase cab ridership?**

## Strategies proposed
Based on our analysis, we have proposed three strategies to increase taxi cabs ridership:
1. Rideshare
2. Tapping dormant boroughs
3. Fare prediction
